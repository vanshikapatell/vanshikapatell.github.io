        Hi, I'm Vanshika Patel, a highly motivated student pursuing a dual major in Finance and Management Information Systems at the Michael F. Price College of Business, University of Oklahoma. With a 3.95 GPA and diverse experiences ranging from investment banking internships to entrepreneurial endeavors, I aim to make an impact in the financial and technological sectors.

        Currently, I serve as the External Relations Chair for the Women in Finance Club and participate in programs like the Capital Group Fellows Program and InvestHER Round Table. Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy mentoring women interested in finance.
